## How It Works

1. When the script runs, it checks the current game's PlaceId.  
2. If it's a BedWars game, it displays a loader GUI, loads two cheat scripts from GitHub, and shows a copyable link.  
3. If it's a baseplate game, it shows a troll prompt GUI asking if the user wants to load troll scripts.  
4. The troll script is loaded from Pastebin if the user clicks the button.

## Usage

1. Inject or paste this script into a Roblox executor.  
2. Join one of the supported games.  
3. Follow the on-screen prompts.
